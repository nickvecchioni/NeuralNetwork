# NeuralNetwork

Implemented a collection of neural network models for digit classification and language identification for CS 188.
Designed various architectures for each task with altered learning rates, hidden layers, and batch sizes.
For each layer, applied a series of weighted linear operaPons followed by the non-linear funcPon ReLU.
Incorporated gradient descent to minimize the sodmax loss as part of the neural net training process. 
Utilized Python as a programming language and the MNIST dataset for NN training and test accuracy.
