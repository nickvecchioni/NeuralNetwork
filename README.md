# NeuralNetwork

A collection of neural network models for digit classification and language identification I created as part of CS 188.

Designed various architectures for each task with altered learning rates, hidden layers, and batch sizes.
For each layer, applied a series of weighted linear operations followed by the non-linear function ReLU.
Incorporated gradient descent to minimize the softmax loss as part of the neural net training process. 
Utilized Python as a programming language and the MNIST dataset for NN training and test accuracy.

Since this is a class project, only some files are provided as reference (in particular, to prevent blatant cheating.) Hence, this README does not provide instructions for running the program, nor does it go into great detail.
